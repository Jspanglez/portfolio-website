# Brief description of the website

My website acts as an online portfolio for myself. My target audience are hiring managers. The website has four pages:
+ About me - An overview of myself including my interests and hobbies.
+ My GitHub - Displays my GitHub repositories with select information.
+ Skills - Lists the languages/things I am proficient in.
+ Contact me - A form that lets the user enter their name, their email, and a message to send. These details are saved to local storage.

The content has been organised in a way that makes it easy for my target audience to either briefly skim through each page or take their time to read everything. Icons are used for navigation on larger screens so that other pages can be interpreted easily.

I have adapted my site for different screen sizes by using media queries. The CSS is done in a mobile-first approach and the first change to the CSS is when the screen is 900px. Other media queries include 1020px, 1300px, 1520px, and 1800px.
